Library Management App
-----------------------
In this project, we will create a Library Management Application using Python programming which will have the following functionalities,
- Fetch all the available books in the library
- Add new books
- Lend books
- Keep a track of borrowed books
- Update the details based on the books returned 
- Remove books from database

Project flow
------------
- In this project 'LibraryDatabase.txt' file has been used as the books collection database. This filename should be entered at the start of the applilcation for loading database for this project.
- The very first step from the user's point of view would be to display the menu of the library management application.
- Following would be the main menu options
1. Display Books
2. Lend a Book
3. Add a Book
4. Return a Book
5. Display Books borrowed
6. Remove a Book
7. Exit

- Depending on the choice entered, we would need to perform the operation and return the details to the output screen.
- The above process has to be done repeatedly until the user quits.

if __name__ == '__main__': is the entry point of the interpreter instead of top down apporach
